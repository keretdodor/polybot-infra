# The Polybot Project

The Polybot Project is a Telegram bot developed using Python and integrated with a REST API to leverage the YOLOv5 AI model for image and photo analysis. The primary goal of this project is to provide human-readable insights from analyzed images in a seamless and user-friendly manner.

To support its functionality, the project is deployed on AWS using an infrastructure designed with Terraform, organized into modules for clarity and maintainability.

To streamline development and operations, I implemented three distinct CI/CD pipelines that automate the infrastructure setup and development workflows, creating a robust and efficient environment for continuous development.
